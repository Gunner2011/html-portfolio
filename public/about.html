<p>I am a 24 year old Romanian-Canadian living in the United States. I am currently working on obtaining my US citizenship as I have lived in america since the age of seven.</p>

<p>University was very fun, both in my social and academic lifes, but after I graduated in December of 2022, I have been having trouble finding a good job in my field of computer science. I have a fiances and a daughter that I am trying to provide for. So far I have worked part time jobs like substitute teaching and door knocking, but I am very much ready for a full time career in Web Development.</p>

<p>I love sushi and many other foods from around the globe. My hobbies include learning, longboarding, and videogaming.</p>
